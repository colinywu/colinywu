    <h3>My Experiences So Far!</h3>
    <img class="round" src="/assets/css/chico/mcdonalds.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>
        Of all my high school experiences, getting my first job at McDonald’s was definitely the most eye-opening and transformative. It was the beginning of my transition into adulthood, as I began interacting with the real-world and became a working member of society. Living a sheltered life, I was brutally awakened to the realities of life: the struggle to make ends meet, the frustrations of the job, and the harshness. While I valued my opportunity to work in customer service, I recognized that I was in a repetitive, dead-end service job that had no room for development. I felt stuck and undervalued, but learned invaluable lessons. I recognized my lack of highly-valued marketable skills—I was limited to unskilled labour. I accepted it but also used it as motivation to work harder to avoid such a career in my future. I truly learned the importance of education and developing my skills as a student to reach my full potential. Looking back, I learned about life as an ordinary worker in fast food and addressed the problems of how I want to make my living and what job I want to define me. I became more appreciative of being fortunate enough to have a supportive family and circumstances that allow me to strive for more. Most importantly, I was driven to capitalize on the opportunities I have been given to reach the top. My perspective was completely shifted.

    <p>This past summer, I had the valuable opportunity to work in retail as a sales associate for Roots. The fast-paced and service-based environment meant we began working independently after one brief orientation session. My manager informed me that my job was to simply interact with customers and sell merchandise. At first, my situation seemed very foreign and overwhelming. The most challenging part of the job was interacting within the formally structured environment. It was difficult to connect with customers under the mindset that I was a seller and they were buyers. Greeting customers, starting spontaneous conversations, promoting our products and, pushing sales onto customers with the ultimate motive of meeting a bottom line was uncomfortable. Over time, I became more familiar with the situation through first-hand exposure and learning through my co-workers. I began to embrace my salesperson role and learned to humanize the process by adding my unique character into my interactions. I began to experience a more genuine and less forced customer-salesperson relationship. I realized that awkwardness is a self-created concept and that even though my circumstances may be fixed, the end product and experiences become what I choose to make them by being myself.

    <p>
        Working in AFSA has been a life-changing experience. Not only did it help me get involved in university, it allowed me to grow into the role of an active and upstanding member in the School of Accounting and Finance. Prior to becoming a project manager, I had no idea all the work and coordination and effort that went into each event. I never understood the importance of logistic planning. Altogether, working with a motivated and extremely dedicated team, I have grown to become much more organized and systematic with my work ethic. We divided the roles for each event among the managers involved: purchasing, logistics, set-up, etc. Additionally, AFSA has allowed me to immerse myself deeper into the world of finance, as I am able to connect with well-respected individuals in investment banking, trading, and so much more. The experience has and continues to be transformative in an enlightening and nurturing manner.
